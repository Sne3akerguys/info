# Who or what is 'ioBroker Community Adapters'?
We are several developers who have joined forces and founded a GitHub & npm organization, initiator was / is jogibear9988.

# Why?
In the past there have been some Adapters wich have no longer been maintained by there Authors. It is possible to continue using the code and create a new package, but the real problem are the death Adapters wich are also available. That brings up a high support, because again and again the same unsolved problems occur with the users.
And that's exactly what we want to try to prevent.

# What are our goals?
- Maintain  Adapters developed by the community
- Improve the quality of the adapters
- Accelerate the development of adapters
- Help newcomers get started

# How does it work?
A developer appears at the organization and transmits his repositories to the organization. This allows any developer within the organization to co-develop, introduce bug fixes and maintain the code even when the author of the Adapter retires.
Likewise, the organization is registered with npm as Maintainer.
Commits / PRs are usually self-validated by the original developers in the commit / PR. Only when the original developer no longer cares about it will be taken over by other developers.

# Criteria for the adapters:
Ala MIT on
